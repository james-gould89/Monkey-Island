# Monkey-Island
This is my text-based game replicating Monkey Island's insult-and-response sword fights. 

This is my first good iteration. of the game using a dictionary to store and check the insults and responses. 

Future improvements I plan to make include:
  single player mode
  play more than one enemy
  Allow players to learn insults and responses when enemies use them
  store gameplay memory in a database to play later
