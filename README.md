# Monkey-Island
This is my text-based game replicating Monkey Island's insult-and-response sword fights. 

This is my first good iteration of the game using a dictionary to store and check the insults and responses. 

Future improvements I plan to make include:
Single-player mode.
Play more than one enemy.
Allow players to learn insults and responses when enemies use them.
Store gameplay memory in a database to play later.
